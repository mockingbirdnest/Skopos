  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>We would like to be able to relay live TV footage from manned spacecraft to mission control via tracking ships. Provide improved connections to our tracking ships.
  notes = The tracking ships USNS Vanguard, Redstone and Mercury have been positioned in the Atlantic and Pacific near the equator. If they are provided with a link to shore, they will be able to use their unified S-band systems to function as a ground station. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = Live TV can now be relayed from tracking ships to mission control.

  rewardReputation = 325    //Kinda hard. Ship terminals are weaker, and ships are positioned in the Atlantic and Pacific, but it should be possible to piggyback off existing infrastructure.
